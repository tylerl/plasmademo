## What It Does

**PREPARE TO BE TRANSPORTED TO 1994!**

*Oh... yeah...*

**Stare in wonder at those mesmerizing sine waves representing nothing in particular!**

*Hnnng...!*

**Generate animated patterns consisting of four *(count em, FOUR!)* overlapping sine waves:**

- Horizontal wave *("kyaa!")*
- Vertical wave *("kaaa... shing!")*
- Diagonal wave *("huwaaahh!")*
- Radial wave from center *("YAAA.. HAAAAA!")*

**Colors cycle smoothly through the spectrum using phase-shifted RGB sine functions.**

*Mmmm... hmmmm...*

**Each run randomizes wave frequencies and directions for unique visual output.**

*TRY TO COLLECT ALL 8 TRILLION!*

## Performance

* Significantly faster on Linux!  (~30fps)
* Windows terminal emulation kinda sucks! (~10fps)
